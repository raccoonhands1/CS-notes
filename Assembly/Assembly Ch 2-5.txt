Start of chapter notes;

clock syncs internal operations of the CPU

Control Unit (CU) coordinates the steps for instructions

arithmetic logic unit ALU performs arithmetic && OR, NOT, etc

CPU contains limited number of storage locations named registers

most CPU pins connect to data bus control bus address bus


Memory storage unit is where instruction are held while a program is running

Storage unit handles RAM -> CPU transfer && vise versa

programs reisding in memopry must be copied to CPU before execution

groups of instructions can be copied together

bus is parallel wires that transfer data

data bus, IO bus, control bus, address bus

Data bus transfers instructions, IO transfers bet CPU && sys output/ in, control bus use binary to sync actions of devices attatched to sys bus. Addresss bus holds addresses of instuctions && data while executions happen

duration of clock cycle is the reciprocal of clock speed, oscillations per second. 1 billion ossc. per second (1GHz) is 1 billionth of a second cycle

some architectures have empty clock cycles called wait states because of CPU speed differences, sys bus, and mem circuits

oInstruction exe cycle--
CPU FETCH INSTRUCTION from INSTRUCTION QUEUE in MEMORY
CPU DECODES INSTRUCTION
IF OPERANDS ARE INVOLVED, THE CPU FETCHES OPERANDS FROM REGISTERS && MEMORY
CPU EXECUTES INSTURCTION
CPU STORES THE OUTPUT IN THE OPERAND //note:: wdym stores in operand

FETCH, DECODE, EXE

Computers read memory slowly because it involves 4 steps to read
PLACEMENT OF ADDRESS OF WHAT IS BEING READ -> CHANGE THE VAL OF PROCESSORS READ PIN - > WAIT A CLOCK CYCLE FOR A RESPONSE -> COPY THE DATA GIVEN

gist:: computers run so fast that it doesnt matter, cache memory speeds it up

L1 cache is stored on the CPU directly
L2 cache is attatched to CPU with a data bus

dynamic ram is slow and cheap but static ram is expensive and fast

GO TO PAGE 77 FOR INFO ON LOADING && EXECUTING A PROGRAM (i hardly need to know it )

ok fine : 
OS searches for filename in disk, if not there -> search through sys paths
OS retrieves file size && location in disk
OS determines next location in memory, loads block.
OS begins from first machine instruction. 

SUMMARY SO FAR:: 
2 types of ram, program exe is sort of cool, CPU architecture goes through many different buses, You can transfer data in big blocks efficiently. Fetch, decode, exe refers to CPU. 1 read == 4 clock cycles

Registers are high speed storage locations in the CPU
8 general purpose regesters, six segment registers, processor status flags register (EFLAGS) and instruction pointer (EIP)

gen purpose are like for arithmetic && such

PAGE 39 FOR MORE INFO ON REGISTERS

The CPU has armor in the form of EFLAGS so it detects integer overflow errors and protects itself with virtual mode && protected mode (control flags)
