Big O Effect as N Examples
O(1)
Independent:
No change
Accessing a value via an array index.
Push / Pop
O(log N)
Logarithmic:
Minimal change.
Binary search for a value in an ordered array
O(N)
Linear growth with N:
Proportional change
Accessing each element in array via 1→ N loop
O(NlogN)
Slightly more than
linear growth.
“Good Sorts” (Merge sort / Quick Sort).
(A LOT More on this later)
O(N^2) Significant growth Bubble Sort. Outer Loop of x = 1 →N containing an inner
loop of Y = 2 → N. Test each element against all others
O(2^N) Exponential growth Recursive calculation of Fibonacci numbers.
